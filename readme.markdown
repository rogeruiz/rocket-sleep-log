Rocket May's Baby Sleep Log
===

A D3 driven baby sleep log to track a baby's sleep.


#### Installing Dependencies

`npm install`
`bower install`

#### Running Server

Running the server in development requires to Terminal sections to be open at
this time. In the future, I'm hoping for development to be much more
streamlined and only require at-most one command to boot the app.

Run in a Terminal session to start the server:
`DEBUG=rocket-sleep-log PORT=3000 bin/www`

Run in a separate Terminal session to start the asset pipeline:
`grunt watch`

At this point the application is available at http://localhost:3000/
